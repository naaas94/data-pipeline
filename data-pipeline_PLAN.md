# Data Pipeline: Detailed Implementation Plan

**Project Type:** Modular Data Engineering & Curation Pipeline  
**Stack:** Python • Pandas • Great Expectations (optional)  
**Purpose:** Automated, auditable generation of high-quality, curated training datasets for privacy intent classification, ready for downstream ML pipelines.

---

## Overview

This project implements a robust, production-aligned data pipeline for the synthesis, validation, and curation of training datasets for privacy intent classification. The pipeline is designed to simulate or process raw data, enforce data quality standards, perform stratified sampling and balancing, and export reproducible datasets for model development in the PCC ecosystem.

---

## Key Learnings & Tensions

- **Data Scarcity:** In the absence of real labeled data, the pipeline must support simulation of labeled datasets and control groups, with all parameters logged for transparency.
- **Automated Curation:** Steps like validation, stratified sampling, and class balancing can be automated, but the pipeline should allow for manual review or override where expert judgment is critical.
- **Data Quality:** Strict schema validation and data quality checks are essential to avoid garbage-in, garbage-out scenarios.
- **Integration:** The output must be directly consumable by the model-training-pipeline, with clear documentation and reproducibility.

│   ├── validators/
│   │   ├── schema_validator.py   # Schema and type checks
│   │   └── quality_checks.py     # Nulls, outliers, duplicates, etc.
│   └── utils/
│       ├── logger.py             # Standardized logging
│       └── sampling.py           # Stratified and random sampling
├── output/                       # Curated datasets (CSV/Parquet)
├── tests/                        # Unit and integration tests
├── requirements.txt              # Dependencies
├── README.md                     # Documentation
└── .env / config.yaml            # Configurations (optional)
```

### 2. Data Synthesis or Ingestion

- **Simulate Data:** If no real data, generate synthetic labeled datasets and control groups, with parameters (class balance, feature distributions) logged.
- **Ingest Data:** If real data is available, support loading from CSV, Parquet, or cloud sources.
- **Tension:** All simulation logic must be reproducible and documented.

---

### 3. ETL & Data Validation

- **Schema Validation:** Enforce required columns, types, and shapes.
- **Quality Checks:** Nulls, outliers, duplicates, and value ranges.
- **Great Expectations:** (Optional) Integrate for data quality reporting.
- **Logging:** All validation steps and failures must be logged for auditability.

---

### 4. Stratified Sampling & Grouping

- **Stratified Sampling:** Ensure representative class and feature distributions (e.g., by intent, channel, semantic density).
- **Control Groups:** Automate creation of control/test groups if needed.
- **Parameterization:** Allow sampling strategies to be set via config or CLI.

---

### 5. Class Balancing & Enrichment

- **Balancing:** Apply SMOTE, oversampling, or undersampling as needed.
- **Enrichment:** Add synthetic features or metadata if required for downstream tasks.
- **Logging:** All transformations and parameters must be logged for reproducibility.

---

### 6. Export & Integration

- **Export:** Save curated datasets to `/output/curated_training_data.csv` or `.parquet`.
- **Instructions:** Provide clear steps for transferring datasets to the model-training-pipeline (`/data/`).
- **(Optional) Cloud Export:** Support export to BigQuery or cloud storage for enterprise scenarios.

---

### 7. Documentation & Reproducibility

- **README.md:** Must include:
  - Project purpose and architecture
  - Usage instructions and configuration
  - Integration points with model-training-pipeline and PCC
  - Example commands and expected outputs
  - Explicit notes on simulated vs. real data, and manual vs. automated curation
- **Traceability:** All simulation, validation, and curation logic must be documented.

---

### 8. Testing & Data Quality Assurance

- **Unit Tests:** For ETL, validation, and sampling logic.
- **Integration Tests:** End-to-end test with a sample run.
- **Schema Validation:** Ensure compatibility with evolving requirements.

---

## Example CLI Usage

```bash
# Generate and export a curated training dataset
python src/data_pipeline.py --config config.yaml

# Output: output/curated_training_data.csv
```

---

## Integration with PCC Ecosystem

- **Output:** Curated, validated training dataset for model-training-pipeline (`/output/curated_training_data.csv` or `.parquet`).
- **Traceability:** All data generation, validation, and curation steps are logged and versioned.
- **Reproducibility:** Datasets can be regenerated on demand with identical results given the same parameters.

---

## Design Principles

- **Data Quality:** Enforce strict validation and curation at every stage.
- **Reproducibility:** Deterministic outputs, versioned logic and parameters.
- **Auditability:** Transparent logging and documentation of all steps.
- **Modularity:** Decoupled ETL, validation, and export components for easy extension.
- **Production-Readiness:** Outputs and logs suitable for real-world ML engineering workflows.

*This plan reflects a sober, professional approach to data engineering and ML curation, emphasizing clarity, traceability, and production alignment. All documentation and code should maintain this standard throughout the project lifecycle.*

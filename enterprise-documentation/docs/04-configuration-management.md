# Configuration Management

## Configuration Files

Configuration files in the `enterprise-data-pipeline` system are crucial for defining the behavior and settings of the data pipeline. These files are typically written in YAML format, which is human-readable and easy to edit. The primary purpose of these configuration files is to:

1. **Define Processing Engines**: Specify which processing engine to use (e.g., Pandas, Spark, Ray) based on the availability and requirements.
2. **Set Data Sources**: Configure the source of data, which can be synthetic, CSV, Parquet, Kafka, or BigQuery.
3. **Control Sampling and Validation**: Define strategies for data sampling and validation checks to ensure data quality.
4. **Manage Output Settings**: Specify the format and location for saving processed data.
5. **Enable Monitoring and Logging**: Configure logging levels and enable metrics collection for monitoring the pipeline's performance.

### Organization

The configuration files are organized in a structured manner to facilitate easy access and modification. Here is a typical structure:

- **`config.yaml`**: The main configuration file that includes all the settings for the data pipeline. It is loaded at the initialization of the `EnterpriseDataPipeline` class.
- **Sections**:
  - `processing`: Contains settings for the processing engine and streaming options.
  - `data_source`: Defines the type and path of the data source.
  - `sampling`: Specifies the sampling strategy and parameters.
  - `validation`: Includes settings for schema and quality checks.
  - `output`: Configures the output format and path.
  - `monitoring`: Enables or disables metrics collection.

## Dynamic Configuration

Dynamic configuration allows the system to adapt to changes without requiring a restart. This can be achieved through:

1. **Environment Variables**: Override specific configuration settings using environment variables. This is useful for deployment environments where certain settings need to be adjusted dynamically.
2. **Configuration Management Tools**: Use tools like Consul, etcd, or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to manage configurations centrally and update them in real-time.
3. **APIs**: Implement APIs that allow external systems to update configuration settings. This can be useful for integrating with other services that need to adjust the pipeline's behavior.

### Tools and APIs

- **YAML Libraries**: Use libraries like PyYAML to load and parse YAML configuration files. This is already implemented in the `_load_config` method of the `EnterpriseDataPipeline` class.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Utilize structured logging and metrics collection to monitor configuration changes and their impact on the pipeline's performance. The `PipelineLogger` class provides structured logging and integrates with Prometheus for metrics collection.

### Example Code

Here is an example of how the configuration is loaded and used in the `EnterpriseDataPipeline` class:

```python
class EnterpriseDataPipeline:
    def __init__(self, config_path: str):
        self.config = self._load_config(config_path)
        self.logger = get_logger("data_pipeline", self.config)
        self.processing_engine = self.config.get('processing', {}).get('engine', 'pandas')
        self.streaming_enabled = self.config.get('processing', {}).get('streaming', {}).get('enabled', False)
        self._init_processing_engines()

    def _load_config(self, config_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Load configuration from YAML file."""
        try:
            with open(config_path, 'r') as file:
                config = yaml.safe_load(file)
            return config
        except Exception as e:
            raise ValueError(f"Failed to load config from {config_path}: {e}")
```

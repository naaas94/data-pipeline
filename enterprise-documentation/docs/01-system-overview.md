# System Overview

## Purpose and Vision

- The primary purpose of the data pipeline is to facilitate privacy intent classification. This involves processing data to identify and categorize user intents related to privacy, such as requests for data deletion or opting out of data collection.

- **Key Objectives**:
  - **Privacy Intent Classification**: The pipeline is equipped to classify various privacy-related intents using machine learning models.
  - **Distributed Processing**: It supports distributed processing using engines like Spark and Ray, allowing for scalable data handling.
  - **Streaming and Cloud Integration**: The pipeline can handle streaming data via Kafka and integrate with cloud services like Google BigQuery.

- **Value to Users**: By automating privacy intent classification, the pipeline helps organizations efficiently manage user privacy requests, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and enhancing user trust.

## Core Philosophy

- **Data Privacy**: The pipeline is built with a strong emphasis on data privacy, ensuring that user data is handled securely and in compliance with relevant regulations.

- **Scalability**: It is designed to scale with the needs of the organization, supporting large volumes of data and distributed processing to handle increasing workloads.

- **Integration Capabilities**: The pipeline can integrate with various data sources and processing engines, providing flexibility and adaptability to different organizational needs.

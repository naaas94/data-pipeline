# Observability and Monitoring

## Metrics and Logging

- The pipeline collects various metrics to monitor performance, such as processing time, data quality scores, and system resource utilization. These metrics are crucial for identifying bottlenecks and ensuring efficient operation. For example, Prometheus can be configured to collect these metrics:
  
  ```yaml
  prometheus:
    enabled: true
    port: 9090
  ```

- Logging mechanisms are implemented using structured logging with JSON format to ensure logs are machine-readable. Log levels include DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, and ERROR, providing detailed insights into the pipeline's operation. Context tracking is implemented for request tracing and correlation. Here is an example of how logging can be set up in Python:

  ```python
  import logging
  import json_log_formatter

  formatter = json_log_formatter.JSONFormatter()

  json_handler = logging.FileHandler(filename='/var/log/my-log.json')
  json_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

  logger = logging.getLogger('my_json')
  logger.addHandler(json_handler)
  logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

  logger.info('This is a log message', extra={'key': 'value'})
  ```

## Health Checks

- Regular health checks are configured to monitor the system's components. These checks ensure that services are running as expected and can include checks for service availability, response times, and error rates. For instance, a simple health check can be implemented in Python:

  ```python
  import requests

  def check_service_health(url):
      try:
          response = requests.get(url)
          if response.status_code == 200:
              return True
          else:
              return False
      except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
          return False

  # Example usage
  is_healthy = check_service_health('http://localhost:8080/health')
  ```

- Alerts are set up to notify the team of any issues that arise, such as service downtime or performance degradation. These alerts can be integrated with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to provide real-time notifications.

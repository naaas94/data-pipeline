# Current Status and Next Steps Before Production

## Current Status
- The test suite for the Enterprise Data Pipeline has been executed, revealing some warnings and potential issues.
- Verbose logging has been enabled, providing detailed insights into the execution flow.
- The `great_expectations` configuration appears to be correctly set up, with various data sources and validation configurations defined.
- Dependencies are specified in `requirements.txt`, and it is recommended to ensure they are up to date.

## Issues Identified
- Warnings related to `pytest_asyncio` indicate a deprecation that needs addressing.
- Debug logs from `great_expectations` suggest that the configuration is being processed, but further validation is needed to ensure correctness.

## Next Steps
1. **Run Individual Tests**: Isolate any specific test causing issues by running them individually.
2. **Address Warnings**: Set the `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope` explicitly in the test configuration to resolve the deprecation warning.
3. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are up to date by running `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`.
4. **Review Logs**: Examine the logs for any specific errors or warnings that might indicate the source of the hang.
5. **Validate `great_expectations` Setup**: Confirm that the `great_expectations` setup is functioning as expected and that all expectations are met.
6. **Prepare for Production**: Once the above steps are completed, prepare the pipeline for production deployment by ensuring all configurations are optimized and tested thoroughly.

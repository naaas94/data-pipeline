# Project Status and Next Steps

This document outlines the current status of the PCC Data Pipeline project and the next steps required to move it towards production readiness.

## ‚úÖ Recently Completed Production-Readiness Tasks

The following major tasks have been successfully completed, bringing the project closer to a production-ready state:

1.  **Production Configuration:**
    - A production-specific configuration file, `config.prod.yaml`, has been created.
    - It is configured to use Spark, Kafka, and Google Cloud Storage for a production environment.
    - Placeholders for secrets (e.g., `${GCP_PROJECT_ID}`) have been included to facilitate secure secret management.

2.  **Dependency Audit and Update:**
    - The `requirements.txt` file has been audited.
    - All project dependencies have been updated to their latest compatible versions.
    - Resolved package conflicts and build issues to ensure a stable installation.

3.  **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement:**
    - The CI/CD workflow in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` has been enhanced.
    - Added a `pylint` step for stricter code quality checks.
    - Added a `bandit` step for static security analysis.
    - Consolidated the Docker build, push, and `trivy` vulnerability scan into a single, efficient job.

4.  **Final Documentation Review:**
    - A full review of all documentation in the `enterprise-documentation/` directory has been completed.
    - All documents have been verified to be accurate and aligned with the refactored codebase.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues / Skipped Tasks

1.  **Great Expectations Validation:**
    - The validation of the Great Expectations suite was **skipped** due to persistent and unresolved CLI and configuration errors.
    - Multiple attempts to initialize a data context, both programmatically and via the CLI, were unsuccessful. This suggests a potential issue with the environment or the Great Expectations installation itself.
    - **Recommendation:** This should be revisited with a fresh environment or a more in-depth debugging session.

## üöÄ Future Work / Next Steps for Production

With the core components now stable and coherent, the following steps are recommended to fully prepare the pipeline for a production environment:

1.  **Implement Secret Management:**
    - The `config.prod.yaml` uses placeholders for secrets. The pipeline code needs to be updated to load these secrets from environment variables or a dedicated secret manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
    - **Action:** Implement a function to resolve these placeholders at runtime.

2.  **Complete Great Expectations Integration:**
    - Revisit the Great Expectations setup.
    - **Action:** Attempt to initialize a new Great Expectations project in a clean environment to rule out local configuration issues. If the CLI continues to fail, the programmatic approach in `tests/validate_data.py` should be debugged further.

3.  **End-to-End Deployment Test:**
    - The CI/CD pipeline includes a deployment job, but it is currently a placeholder.
    - **Action:** Set up a staging environment in the target cloud (e.g., AWS ECS) and perform a full end-to-end deployment test to ensure the Docker container runs and the pipeline can connect to all services.

4.  **Implement Comprehensive Performance Testing:**
    - The CI/CD pipeline has a placeholder for performance tests.
    - **Action:** Implement performance tests using a tool like Locust to simulate a production-level load and identify any performance bottlenecks in the pipeline.

# HYBRID LLM APPROACH FOR SYNTHETIC DATA GENERATION

## OVERVIEW
COMBINE LLM-GENERATED CONVERSATIONS WITH RULE-BASED INTENT CLASSIFICATION FOR BETTER SYNTHETIC DATA

## KEY BENEFITS
- INFINITE VARIETY FROM LLM GENERATION
- CONTROLLED INTENT DISTRIBUTION FROM RULES
- REALISTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE CONVERSATIONS
- MAINTAINS DATA QUALITY AND CONSISTENCY

## IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### PHASE 1: LLM CONVERSATION GENERATION
- USE OPEN-SOURCE LLM (LLAMA, MISTRAL, ETC.)
- FEW-SHOT PROMPTING WITH CURATED EXAMPLES
- GENERATE DIVERSE CONVERSATION TEMPLATES

### PHASE 2: RULE-BASED REFINEMENT
- APPLY EXISTING INTENT CLASSIFICATION LOGIC
- USE CURRENT CONFIDENCE SCORING METHODS
- ADD CONTROLLED NOISE AND VARIATIONS

### PHASE 3: QUALITY CONTROL
- VALIDATE CONVERSATION STRUCTURE
- ENSURE PROPER INTENT DISTRIBUTION
- MAINTAIN DATA SCHEMA CONSISTENCY

## CODE STRUCTURE
```python
def generate_hybrid_data(self, n_samples: int = 10000) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # 1. LLM generates conversation templates
    # 2. Apply rule-based intent classification
    # 3. Add controlled variations
    # 4. Return structured DataFrame
```

## NEXT STEPS
- RESEARCH OPEN-SOURCE LLM OPTIONS
- DESIGN FEW-SHOT PROMPTS
- IMPLEMENT VALIDATION LAYER
- TEST WITH SMALL DATASET FIRST

## REMEMBER
THIS APPROACH COMBINES THE BEST OF BOTH METHODS:
- LLM CREATIVITY AND DIVERSITY
- RULE-BASED RELIABILITY AND CONTROL
